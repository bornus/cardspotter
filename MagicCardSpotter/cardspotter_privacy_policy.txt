CardSpotter Privacy Policy

When CardSpotter is enabled it injects a content script into all frames, this is done to handle videos embedded in iframes. This content script will look for key words in the page meta to automatically configure itself.

CardSpotter uses video data to figure out what card you click on. For the card it thinks you clicked on it will request price information from www.cardhoarder.com and www.tcgplayer.com as well as an image from www.cardspotter.com. These webhosts may all collect information about you such as your web browser, the url CardSpotter was injected into, the url that was requested from them, your IP address and geolocation.

CardSpotter will periodically sample the information about the requested images and what video they were requested to check correctness in an effort to improve the quality of the product.

If any of this changes, this privacy policy will be changed to reflect that.
