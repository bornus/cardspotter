CardSpotter is a browser extension that show automatic Magic:The Gathering card image tooltips for <video> streams. Tooltip shows the card image with a scryfall link.

It works by grabbing data from HTML5 video, extracting the clicked card using OpenCV and then finding the best match from a database using image hashing.
